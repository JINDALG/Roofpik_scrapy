http://www.mensxp.com/dating/inner-game/7008-married-life-vs-bachelorhood.html,"[u'\n\t', u'Men often reach a point in their lives when they must make that important decision \u2013 \u201cdo I get married?', u'\n\tOr do I finish the last beer in the fridge?\u201d And believe me these are not easy decisions to make. Of course the beer almost ', u'always wins', u', because once you are married, there is no such thing as a last beer in the fridge. You will make sure you have a steady and continuous flow of alcohol.', u'\n\tWhich brings us to the topic of discussion; Marriage vs. Bachelorhood, which is really better? The bachelors will obviously say their way of life rocks, and married men, well, will agree. This is because men do not get married for the same reason women do. A woman gets married because she wants to settle down, raise a family and build a home. A man gets married because that\u2019s the only way to get a woman to sleep with him without taking her out on an expensive date. BIG difference.', u'\n\tBachelors, on the other hand, have it pretty good. You wouldn\u2019t really associate the word \u2018responsibility\u2019 to a man that isn\u2019t married. But then again, these men have their own cup of woes to deal with. Having to decide where to party on a Saturday night, waking up next to women, sometimes even men they don\u2019t know and then forgetting to call these women and men back. This is not the kind of life for the everyday guy. So if you look at it, so far, both married and bachelor life pretty much suck.', u'\n\tBut let\u2019s look at this from a different point of view. How much does marriage really ', u'change the lifestyle', u' of a bachelor? Now you have a gorgeous woman who you love living with you. If your luck is good and she\u2019s a great cook, then add fresh, homemade food to the list. And in the long run, the two of you will be able to celebrate the miracle of birth when you have kids. Is this really that bad? Well not until her mother shows up, but we\u2019ll leave that for another day. The real issue that most married men have with being married is not marriage itself; rather it\u2019s all the fun things that they have to give up, just because there is a woman in the house. Let\u2019s face it video games are cool, no matter how old you are. And what is wrong if a man wants to completely ignore the existence of his wife during a football match? The odd fart once in a while in the corner of the living room is just him marking his territory. Let him be.', u'\n\tThe real deal here is to know when your time as a bachelor is up and when you should look at finding a bride. In all honesty, it takes a certain amount of panache to pull off the bachelor way of life well into your forties. Besides George Clooney and Johnny Depp, very few men make it look cool. Unless you want to be frowned upon by everyone in your family as well as the neighbour\u2019s cat, pick an age by which you think you\u2019ll be done with all the things that married life does not permit, because that\u2019s the only reason why men prefer to remain single isn\u2019t it?', u'\n\tA smart man is one who strikes a balance between bachelorhood and ', u'marriage', u', but it takes a genius to live like a bachelor even after you tie the knot, but again, more on that in another article. The way I would go about it, is to make a plan of sorts, put together a list of things I want to do by myself, like travel, adventure sports and Sudoku puzzles. Once I have exhausted the list, I\u2019ll find a young girl to make my wife. No matter how much you swear by being single and all the greatness it offers, you gotta accept the fact that farts don\u2019t smell that good when you are 65 and living on your own.', u'\n\tLearn to get the best out of both phases of your adult life. There is no real winner in this argument. Bachelors end up wanting what married men have (their wives), married men want what bachelors have (a fridge full of beer, even trade?). So it\u2019s a vicious cycle eventually. Every man must compulsorily face the challenge and ecstasy of being a bachelor and then by choice rue the decision of getting married. Such is the way of life.

http://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/106078-Married-life-Bachelor-life.aspx,"[u'\n                ', u'Each man and woman of this world has two stages in their life before marriage and after marriage. We shall discuss about the troubles and pleasures they are facing in these two stages here.', u'\n            ', u'Married life', u'In married life we get more relationships. Love and care of Husband/Wife, In-laws and children are greatest feeling we cannot get in bachelor life. Being a parent is a great blessing and caring our parents and In-laws by giving them rest is greatest blessing. Can find pleasure and boon in serving our family with whole heart. Also we have full freedom and license to spend days with our beloveds in married life only. In bachelor life we are dependent on parents but here we are independent to make decisions and fulfill our wishes. The responsibility comes after marriage makes us realize what is life? and what we are living for? ', u""But in married life we are in lots of pressure to lead the family. The status of the one who hasn't get the right life partner is pitiable. His/her life will be a struggle with the daily fights for silly matters, ego problems, suspect ions, unexpected words from our loved one etc.,"", u'Married women', u""They have to care In-laws, children and relations in the married life. They have to be bounded to house maintaining pressure in the daily life from sending the children school till making all the family members to sleep by caring them and their health, worries they have in the outside world etc., They have responsibility of guiding and bringing up children in a right way. They have to guide in their Home works. They need to cook for their family. After all they should first know how to treat and mingle with the people(relatives) in In-laws house. They should be trained and to be adjustable with all the members of their husband's family. If leading life individually then managing house is more difficult than joint family. Because they won't have the family members who were the ladies of their husband's family. They should change their mind set to live without the assistance of their parents who were with them till the marriage."", u'Married men', u'He will be little free from financial pressures as he has his life partner to discuss about the financial matters before spending it. Being Financial head he should be responsible for earning, loan, Insurances, shares, etc etc. Not only financial pressure they are also out of pressure to satisfy and give pleasure to family members as it would be a responsibility of Family head. Bachelor life is free from all these. All the big decisions have to be taken by them without depending anyone than the life partner. The responsibilities will sometime tight them in a fixed job for lot of years by barring the bad events happening at the office or work places. He has to be the role model for his children. So he has to get away from the world that he was living before his marriage with his friends before marriage. ', u'Bachelor life', u'In Bachelor life we can enjoy by being out of pressures. We are not bound to responsibilities mentioned in married life. Here we can be very relaxed from managing and making life. All advices guidelines and supports are given by parents. We have to just follow them to get it out done. we will be given full care. All responsibilities are taken over by our parents. Earning at bachelor life is just like a pass time. Here we can just earn and give to parents. All managing works are done by parents and spending with our own money will be nice.', u""If we think about the worries we have in the bachelor life, the most part of the answer will be occupied by the words love and friendship that will dis appear from our life in the practical future days before the surviving needs. In the bachelor life we have no need to think about taking and changing the decisions like joining or leaving a job. Because we can be in home for few days till getting the better job with the support of our parents. But after marriage we can't do so, because if we didn't earn a month, then the next month food of the members of the family under us will get question mark. "", u'We can go anywhere without worrying about anything. For an example, in the bachelor life we can go any tourist place with our friends or alone and go where ever we want and enjoy. But after marriage where ever we go, we have to go with family else we will be questioned. Going with the family we have to be thinking about them ever at the tourist place we have gone. Even Though we are enjoying, we have to be thinking about them that when they will feel hungry, what will make them sick, to which places and all we can get them, what are the secured tourist places, what are the healthy foods to have etc.,', u'I am 29 years of age as of date and enjoying my life as a bachelor and intend to continue to live like this till I die. Yes some of your statements regarding marriage are quite enticing for bachelors to get started on considering marriage as a future life choice but when these are scrutinized in detail the restrictions and risks that marriage carries are simply too much for a man to handle. Personally I rather live like a Tiger Solitary and Powerful and free for life than like a Lion who has to live in a pack and carry the burden of his pack for life.', u'On reading this article I remember a comparison my college lecturer,who was just married, told us when we asked about how he felt as married man.', u'His remark was that marriage was a destination all bachelors are in a hurry to reach at, and the already married want to return but not able to do so, being trapped for life.

Love and care of Husband/Wife, In-laws and children are greatest feeling we cannot get in bachelor life. Being a parent is a great blessing and caring our parents and In-laws by giving them rest is greatest blessing. Can find pleasure and boon in serving our family with whole heart. Also we have full freedom and license to spend days with our beloveds in married life only. In bachelor life we are dependent on parents but here we are independent to make decisions and fulfill our wishes. The responsibility comes after marriage makes us realize what is life? and what we are living for? ', u""But in married life we are in lots of pressure to lead the family. The status of the one who hasn't get the right life partner is pitiable. His/her life will be a struggle with the daily fights for silly matters, ego problems, suspect ions, unexpected words from our loved one etc.,"", u'Married women', u""They have to care In-laws, children and relations in the married life. They have to be bounded to house maintaining pressure in the daily life from sending the children school till making all the family members to sleep by caring them and their health, worries they have in the outside world etc., They have responsibility of guiding and bringing up children in a right way. They have to guide in their Home works. They need to cook for their family. After all they should first know how to treat and mingle with the people(relatives) in In-laws house. They should be trained and to be adjustable with all the members of their husband's family. If leading life individually then managing house is more difficult than joint family. Because they won't have the family members who were the ladies of their husband's family. They should change their mind set to live without the assistance of their parents who were with them till the marriage."", u'Married men', u'He will be little free from financial pressures as he has his life partner to discuss about the financial matters before spending it. Being Financial head he should be responsible for earning, loan, Insurances, shares, etc etc. Not only financial pressure they are also out of pressure to satisfy and give pleasure to family members as it would be a responsibility of Family head. Bachelor life is free from all these. All the big decisions have to be taken by them without depending anyone than the life partner. The responsibilities will sometime tight them in a fixed job for lot of years by barring the bad events happening at the office or work places. He has to be the role model for his children. So he has to get away from the world that he was living before his marriage with his friends before marriage. ', u'Bachelor life', u'In Bachelor life we can enjoy by being out of pressures. We are not bound to responsibilities mentioned in married life. Here we can be very relaxed from managing and making life. All advices guidelines and supports are given by parents. We have to just follow them to get it out done. we will be given full care. All responsibilities are taken over by our parents. Earning at bachelor life is just like a pass time. Here we can just earn and give to parents. All managing works are done by parents and spending with our own money will be nice.', u""If we think about the worries we have in the bachelor life, the most part of the answer will be occupied by the words love and friendship that will dis appear from our life in the practical future days before the surviving needs. In the bachelor life we have no need to think about taking and changing the decisions like joining or leaving a job. Because we can be in home for few days till getting the better job with the support of our parents. But after marriage we can't do so, because if we didn't earn a month, then the next month food of the members of the family under us will get question mark. "", u'We can go anywhere without worrying about anything. For an example, in the bachelor life we can go any tourist place with our friends or alone and go where ever we want and enjoy. But after marriage where ever we go, we have to go with family else we will be questioned. Going with the family we have to be thinking about them ever at the tourist place we have gone. Even Though we are enjoying, we have to be thinking about them that when they will feel hungry, what will make them sick, to which places and all we can get them, what are the secured tourist places, what are the healthy foods to have etc.,', u'Guest Author: Tiger Woods', u'18 Oct 2013', u'Author: ', u'Venkiteswaran.', u'05 Jul 2014']",[u'Married Life vs Bachelor Life'],[],"[u'Comments', u'Subscribe to Email', u'Online Members']",[],[],[],[u'\n\tMarried Life vs Bachelor Life\n'],[],"[u'Login', u'Register', u'Forum', u'Articles', u'Ask Experts', u'Exams ', u'Exam Results', u'Practice Tests', u'Question Papers', u'Education ', u'Admissions', u'Learn English', u'Universities', u'Colleges', u'Courses', u'Schools', u'Study Abroad', u'More ', u'Jobs', u'Reviews', u'Social Hub', u'New Posts', u'My India', u'Post Content', u'Do not include your name, ""with regards"" etc in the comment.
